# dvdscr
An implementation of the all-time classic DVD screensaver. It's customisable, 
too, namely you can:
- change the bouncing picture and
- adjust the bouncing speed.
To do this, press Ctrl + O. Click Apply to apply the changes. Press Ctrl + O to 
hide the Settings window. Press Escape to exit the app.
## Dependencies
`sfml`, `imgui-sfml` and `thor-git`, all of which can be obtained from the AUR 
or from each project's repositories respectively.
## Building
Just run `make` and (optionally) `make clean` to get rid of the object files.
